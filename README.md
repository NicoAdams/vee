A game with jumping and music

## Getting started

This is an npm-managed project, so all the dependencies should be downloaded already in `node_modules`. To run the app:
```
./run
```

Random notes: 

* Electron uses ES6, which is like regular javascript, but has a bunch of new features (most of them great). Here is a quick article on it: https://webapplog.com/es6/

/* Here is where all the character settings should be set up
 * This file should house a characters size + shape, physics properties, and
 * key-control scheme. We can mess around with this to try out a couple
 * different control schemes/properties for the character 
 * 
 * The character is updated by having keys queue "actions", which are run on
 * "character.update(dt)". This guarantees that you can press a key at any time
 * and the character will respond, but the character's physics will be updated
 * at the same time as all other physics
